<hr />

<h3>▪️ Dear Comrade (2019)</h3>
<p>I like Dear Comrade (2019) because it blends intense emotion with a strong message about healing and self-worth. The relationship between Bobby and Lilly feels raw and real, showing how love isn’t just about passion but also about supporting someone through their struggles. I like that the film doesn’t shy away from difficult topics, and the music adds so much depth that it becomes an experience rather than just a story.</p>
<hr /><h3>▪️ Meesaya Murukku (2017)</h3>
<p>I like Meesaya Murukku (2017) for how refreshingly simple and relatable it is. It’s the kind of movie that feels close to real life, especially in the way it shows the struggles of chasing a dream while staying true to who you are. I like that the film carries a youthful, positive vibe, and the music blends effortlessly with the story, making it both inspiring and enjoyable.</p>
<hr /><h3>▪️ Passengers (2016)</h3>
<p>I like Passengers (2016) because it takes a unique science-fiction idea and turns it into an emotional story about loneliness, connection, and difficult choices. The visual world of the Avalon spaceship is stunning, and I like that the film focuses not just on futuristic elements but also on the human feelings behind the characters’ decisions. The relationship between Jim and Aurora adds a thought-provoking layer that stays with you even after the movie ends.</p>
