<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr />
<p>I’m Adhi, a passionate tech enthusiast with a strong foundation in modern software development, problem-solving, and creative innovation. I enjoy building practical, user-focused solutions—whether it’s dynamic web applications, smart utilities like GPA calculators, or idea-driven prototypes for innovation challenges. My work blends clarity, structure, and creativity, reflecting my commitment to continuous learning and impactful execution.
</p>
<p>Beyond coding, I actively explore emerging technologies, design thinking, and innovation frameworks. As an Innovation Ambassador, I’ve completed multiple modules on creativity, NEP/NISP, and entrepreneurial thinking, applying those skills to real-world idea development such as AquaMist and SoleCharge. I enjoy transforming concepts into structured solutions with clear technical and non-technical reasoning.
</p>
<p>Collaboration and curiosity define my approach. I love working with teams, brainstorming ideas, and contributing to events—from academic initiatives to symposium planning like SpeKECtra. Whether it’s developing tools, simplifying complex topics for peers, or creating polished products, I aim to bring value, precision, and enthusiasm to every project I take on.
